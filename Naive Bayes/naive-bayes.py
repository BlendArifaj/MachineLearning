Bayesâ€™ Theorem is stated as:

P(h|d) = (P(d|h) * P(h)) / P(d)

Where

P(h|d) is the probability of hypothesis h given the data d. This is called the posterior probability.
P(d|h) is the probability of data d given that the hypothesis h was true.
P(h) is the probability of hypothesis h being true (regardless of the data). This is called the prior probability of h.
P(d) is the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis).
You can see that we are interested in calculating the posterior probability of P(h|d) from the prior probability p(h) with P(D) and P(d|h).
